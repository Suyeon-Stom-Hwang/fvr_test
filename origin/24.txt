Freedom Caucus loses another member to internal divisions
Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) is leaving the right-wing House Freedom Caucus over its opposition to her efforts to allow House members who are new parents to vote by proxy, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: Luna is the fourth member that the Freedom Caucus has lost or ejected in the last two years over growing internal divisions.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) was booted from the group in 2023 over her support for then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).
The caucus voted to kick out Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) last July for endorsing a primary challenger to then-Freedom Caucus chair Bob Good (R-Va.), prompting Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) to resign in protest.
Driving the news: "With a heavy heart, I am resigning from the Freedom Caucus," Luna wrote in a "dear colleague" letter obtained by Axios.

The Florida Republican said individual Freedom Caucus members' attempts to kill her proxy voting rule change "shattered" the "mutual respect that has guided our caucus."
"A small group among us threatened the Speaker, vowing to halt floor proceedings indefinitely ... unless he altered the rules to block my discharge petition," Luna wrote.
Two GOP lawmakers confirmed her decision to leave to Axios. A spokesperson for Luna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The backdrop: Luna bucked House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) — who fought bitterly against COVID-era proxy voting when Democrats controlled the House — in trying to force a vote on her proposed rule change.

Earlier this month she launched what is known as a discharge petition, which forces a vote if it receives the signatures of 218 House members.
Johnson is reportedly attempting to add a provision to a broader Republican procedural measure that would effectively kill her vote.
