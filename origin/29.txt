Why is the Wisconsin Supreme Court race so important? Susan Crawford's win keeps liberals in control
The country was watching closely the results of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race in which liberal Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel in Tuesday's election. The race had reached unprecedented heights this spring with it being the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history.

President Donald Trump endorsed Schimel and billionaire Elon Muskâ€™s million-dollar giveaways sparked backlash from opponents and a lawsuit by Wisconsin's attorney general. 

Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama endorsed Crawford. Overall, more than 100,000 donors from all 50 states contributed to the election.

Why is it so important?

The race determines the ideological control of the state Supreme Court. It's also the first major election since the fall election and can be seen as a referendum against Trump and his policies.
Liberals have a 4-3 advantage in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, but with liberal justice Ann Walsh Bradley not running for re-election, control of the court was at stake.

Abortion, voter ID, redistricting and Act 10 are some of the top issues that could come before the court. Act 10 ended collective bargaining rights for most public employee unions in 2011 but was restored in late 2024.
